Sprint 5 Group Grade Team 41:
------------------------------------------------

Expectations Achieved:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Did you have a  vertically integrated prototype/system deployed to AWS that works. 
   The TAâ€™s and Professors are expecting to use their machines to access the system:
   
    Yes

2. Testing coverage minimum:

    100% Statement Coverage AND 85+% Branch Coverage

3. Project report identifying how far the team is from completion. 
   The metric could be the number of use cases completed versus specified,
   the number of tasks completed versus specified for a release, and so on. 
   Jira can produce reports like this for you: 
   
   Detailed

Comments on Expectations: Team seem to work pretty well together. Identifies and are clearly aware of each members work.

Stretches Achieved:
-----------------------------------------------

(1) Stretch: Multi-platform/browser/database/whatever deployment and testing; (1) Stretch: UI-based testing or more usability testing; (4) Bigger Stretch: Propose movies that a user may like that are on one of their video streaming platforms. The ideal would be to link this against provider libraries or schedules but as an easier first step you can link to a cache.





Comments: Although these were last minute changes. The team did a fair job incorporating the usability testing results.

------------------------------------------------
Team GRADE: 91
------------------------------------------------

Extra Comments: Polished the UI and improvements to the usecases (like session verification for a few API calls) Jira's sprint was not started. No smart commits.
